# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial.  Every programmer should understand these data structures, their uses and drawbacks:

- [Queue](1-queue.md)
- [Linked List](2-linked_list.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
