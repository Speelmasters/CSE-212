# Queues

Programs make use of many different times of data structures. A queue is a linear data structure that uses the First-In-First-Out(FIFO) rule. This means that items that are added to the data structure are also removed first. 

There are several ways to impliment a queue into a Python class. You can use a list ` variable = list()` , a Queue from the queue library can be initialized using `variable = Queue()`, and a deque from the collections library using `variable = deque()`.

When using either of the las two options, they must be imported using
```Python
from collections import deque
from queue import Queue
```

## Queue Methods

### Enqueue
Enqueue adds an item to the end of the queue. This method has essesntially the same for withever data structure you use for your queue. For a list, you can use ` append()` , for a Queue is `
### Dequeue
Dequeue removes the item that was added least recently from the list or queue and returns the value that was stored  in that place.

## Example: Haircut Queue
In the example below, we will write a program that allows the user to add people to the queue and remove them. Before we write the code, we should amke a list of requirements that we want our code to handle.  Writing a list of requirements is an important step in writing software. In this example, we will be using the deque data structure.

Haircut Queue Requirements:
 - Allow user to add client
 - Allow user to get next client
 - Allow user to remove person if in the queue
 - Display all clients in queue


```Python
from collections import deque

clients = deque()
choice = ""
while(choice != "4"):
   print("Welcome to MEGA CUTS!")
   print("Please select and option")
   print("1) Add client")
   print("2) Remove client")
   print("3) Display next client")
   print("4) End program")

   choice = input()

   if (choice == "1"):
      new_client = input("Please enter clients name: ")
      clients.append(new_client)
   elif (choice == "2"):
      remove_client = input("Please enter clients name to be removed: ")
      if clients.__contains__(remove_client):
         clients.remove(remove_client)
         print(remove_client + " was removed from the queue")
      else:
         print(remove_client + " was not in the queue")
   elif (choice == "3"):
      print("Next client is " + clients.pop())
   elif (choice == "4"):
      pass
   else:
      print("Invalid Menu Selection")
```


## Problem to Solve: Limited Queue

Write a program that will only allow a certain number of items into a queue at a time.
