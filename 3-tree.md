# Tree




In this lession, we will be looking at one of the most basic tree structures, the Binary Tree. It is call this because it has at most two child nodes. The nodes consist of the data stored and two pointers. These pointer point to the next node below it, making it look like a tree.

## Tree Methods

### Enqueue
Enqueue adds an item to the end of the queue. This method has essesntially the same for withever data structure you use for your queue. For a list and deque, you can use ` append()`  and for a Queue it is `put()`.
### Dequeue
Dequeue removes the item that was added least recently from the list or queue and returns the value that was stored  in that place. This is essentially helping or getting the the next "person" in line, or the next item to be removed from the queue. To dequeue a list, use `pop(0)`, in a Queue us `pop()` without the 0, and for deque use `get()`

## Example: Haircut Queue
